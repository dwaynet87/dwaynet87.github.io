## About me
Hi!

I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca"> The University of British Columbia (UBC) </a> in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As part of the <a href="https://yonglab.med.ubc.ca"> Endometriosis & Pelvic Pain Laboratory </a> and <a href="https://uterinehealth.ca"> Uterine Health Reasearch Lab </a>, my doctoral research delves into predicting pain outcomes in endometriosis, employing a combination of machine learning, clinical modelling, and molecular pathology approaches.

I also have experience in other disciplines in laboratory medicine including anatomical pathology, bacteriology & virology, and bloodbanking.


Throughout my professional and doctoral career, I have developed a deep interest in applying data-driven insights to advance health outcomes.
