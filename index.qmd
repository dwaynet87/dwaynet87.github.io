## About me
Hi!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in pharmacoepidemiology and health outcomes at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca"> The University of British Columbia (UBC) </a> in Vancouver, British Columbia, and <a href="https://www.arthritisresearch.ca/"> Arthritis Research Canada</a>. My current work focuses on the safety and effectiveness of medications in chronic disease populations, with particular attention to pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis.

My PhD research at UBC, conducted within the <a href="https://yonglab.med.ubc.ca"> Endometriosis & Pelvic Pain Laboratory </a> and <a href="https://uterinehealth.ca"> Uterine Health Reasearch Lab </a>, focused on predicting pain-related outcomes after endometriosis surgery. I combined machine learning and clinical modelling to develop the "Endometriosis Pain Index (EPI)"- a prediction tool designed to support surgical decision-making in endometriosis care. In parallel, I conducted molecular pathology research that showed an association between common cancer-related mutations and endometriosis severity. 

I am also a trained clinical laboratory scientist **with 9 years of experience** specializing in chemical pathology and haematology, gained at <a href="https://www.uwi.edu">The University of the West Indies</a> and the <a href="https://uhwi.gov.jm">University Hospital of the West Indies</a>. I also have experience in other disciplines in laboratory medicine including anatomical pathology, bacteriology & virology, and bloodbanking.


Throughout my professional and doctoral career, I have developed a deep interest in applying data-driven insights to advance health outcomes.
