Rheumatology international.2025  \nThis scoping review examined what is currently known about the use of biosimilar biologic drugs—lower-cost versions of biologic therapies during pregnancy. We identified only six small studies, mostly descriptive, involving biosimilars used to treat autoimmune conditions such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Reported outcomes varied and were inconsistently measured, highlighting major evidence gaps. To improve future research, we proposed a Reproductive Health Outcomes Reporting Framework. Our review is the first synthesis of perinatal evidence on biosimilar DMARDs and underscores the need for larger, standardized studies to guide safe treatment during pregnancy.\n\n\nAssessing the Utility of artificial intelligence in endometriosis: Promises and pitfalls\n Dungate B, Tucker DR, Goodwin E, Yong PJ. Womens Health (Lond). 2024;20:17455057241248121.  \n\nThis study examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can improve the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis, a condition that affects many women but is underfunded and hard to diagnose due to varied symptoms. AI, which analyzes large datasets to find new patterns, is increasingly used in medical research. Its applications in endometriosis include diagnostic tools and treatment prediction, potentially reducing diagnostic delays, healthcare costs, and providing better treatment options. However, AI’s success depends on high-quality data and skilled implementation. The review highlights the need for careful and transparent use of AI to avoid mistakes and ensure reliable outcomes, calling for more oversight in AI research to enhance endometriosis care.\n \n\n\nCircular RNA and its potential as prostate cancer biomarkers\n Tucker D, Zheng W, Zhang DH, Dong X.
