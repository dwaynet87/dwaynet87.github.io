In centralized pain, pain processing in the brain is altered leading to pain perception even after the pain stimili (e.g. endometriosis lesions) is removed.

Womens Health (Lond). 2024;20:17455057241248121.  \n\nThis study examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can improve the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis, a condition that affects many women but is underfunded and hard to diagnose due to varied symptoms. AI, which analyzes large datasets to find new patterns, is increasingly used in medical research. Its applications in endometriosis include diagnostic tools and treatment prediction, potentially reducing diagnostic delays, healthcare costs, and providing better treatment options. However, AI’s success depends on high-quality data and skilled implementation. The review highlights the need for careful and transparent use of AI to avoid mistakes and ensure reliable outcomes, calling for more oversight in AI research to enhance endometriosis care.\n \n\n\nCircular RNA and its potential as prostate cancer biomarkers\n Tucker D, Zheng W, Zhang DH, Dong X.
